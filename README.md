## A Simple Landing Page for a Job Application Form

![Screenshot of the project](./screenshot.png)

This project is a **simple yet fully functional job application form** built with HTML and CSS. It includes form controls, radio buttons, a select dropdown, text area, and form validation to collect job applicant details.

It was built entirely with HTML and CSS as part of the **[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/)** CSS course.

---

## Overview

This form-based project is designed to simulate a typical job application process, where users can fill out their name, email, job position, availability, and a short motivation message.  
It demonstrates proper semantic markup, organized form structure, focus states, field validation, and responsiveness on smaller devices.

The background uses a colorful radial gradient setup that enhances the aesthetic without compromising readability or usability. All fields are styled for accessibility and clarity.
